"this" is a keyword in java, which normally refers to the object on which a method is invoked. In a constructor, it can be used to invoke a constructor from within another constructor.

In your own programs, if you find yourself copying multiple lines of code for reuse, it is usually wise to put the common code into a new shared method.

Any object can have a toString method, and if it does, that method will be automatically called when you concatenate the object to a String. (Actually, _every_object has a toString method, but the default toString isn't particularly enlightening.)

The pseudocode for a recursive GCD function. a and b must be nonnegative.

	function gcd(a,b)
		if b = 0
			return a
		else
			return gcd(b, a mod b)
