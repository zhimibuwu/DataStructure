"javac" is the name of the Java Compiler.

Once javac is able to compile the code, it will create a file called Names.class in the same directory. You can run this program using the Java Interpreter. 

Java automatically appends the ".class" file extension on Name.class. If you accidentally type "java Names.class", java will look for a file called "Names.class.class".

You may think that the file produced by javac is named Names.class because the input file is named Names.java. Not so--the name of the .class file is based on the class name IN Names.java.
